Create a new service account with the name pvviewer. Grant this Service account access to list all PersistentVolumes in the cluster by creating an appropriate cluster role called pvviewer-role and ClusterRoleBinding called pvviewer-role-binding.

- ServiceAccount: pvviewer
- ClusterRole: pvviewer-role
- ClusterRoleBinding: pvviewer-role-binding
- Pod: pvviewer
