Create a static pod on node01 called nginx-critical with image nginx and make sure that it is recreated/restarted automatically in case of a failure.

Use /etc/kubernetes/manifests as the Static Pod path for example.

- static pod configured under /etc/kubernetes/manifests ?
- Pod nginx-critical-node01 is up and running
